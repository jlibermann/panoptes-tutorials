We then count 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and then since we've counted another 10, the next digit changes to a 2 (20).\n",

    "And so on. The reason we get `floating point error` is because there are some numbers which can't be stored correctly in binary. Consider what happens when you divide 10 by 3. The answer is 0.333333... (the 3's go on forever). A computer wouldn't be able to store this number exactly because you can't store an infinite amount of information. Your computer could use all its storage space and still not be able to exactly store this number. When we write 4.2-3.9, python converts those numbers into binary and then subtracts them and then converts it back into decimal to show to us. It is converting back and forth between binary and decimal which produces these errors."
